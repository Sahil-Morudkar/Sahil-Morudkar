Hello There, I am Sahil Morudkar from Mumbai,Maharashtra. I enjoy making good looking functional websites (maybe because of my OCD) and along with front-end I was always keen to know what happens behind the scenes and thereby I have gained much interest in the field of Full Stack Development. I have hands on experience on the tools and technologies required for the same and I am always interested to know more and gain more insights. I have worked on few projects, feel free to check out my repositories and any feedback is always appreciated. I believe we can master particular concepts but upto an extent, we can never gain 100% knowledge on every concept and that's why we will always be learners but being able to acheive what others won't we have to do what others don't <3.
